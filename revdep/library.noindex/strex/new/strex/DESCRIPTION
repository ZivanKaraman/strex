Description: There are some things that I wish were easier with
    the 'stringr' or 'stringi' packages. The foremost of these is the
    extraction of numbers from strings. 'stringr' and 'stringi' make you
    figure out the regular expression for yourself; 'strex' takes care of
    this for you. There are many other handy functionalities in 'strex'.
    Contributions to this package are encouraged: it is intended as a
    miscellany of string manipulation functions that cannot be found in
    'stringi' or 'stringr'.
